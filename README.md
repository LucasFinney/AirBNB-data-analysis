Got everything set up and started playing around with the data. Tried to create a visualization of the distribution of rental frequencies by neighborhood, but there are simply too many categories for that to end up being particularly meaningful. A histogram might help a little bit more for understanding the distribution of frequencies, but even then, that's not going to be super useful. Biggest insight is the fact that the Waterfront district is vastly more popular than any other district, creating a heavily right-skewed distribution of frequencies.
